# tornado-challenger
Web-application that uses Python, Tornado and MongoDB.

Here you can create new challenges, record them, motivate yourself and just improve your skills.
Challenge - is the endpoint, which you want to achieve, and this application gives you interface to 
manage them.

You can for example create challenge - Learn Tornado in a Week, then create Points, which you want to do
during this challenge, for instance Read som book about Tornado and create some project. You can then 
determine how much time you need to do that and save it. It works like to-do list.

This project is written in pure Tornado, as database MongoDB and drive mongoengine are used.
